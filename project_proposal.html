    <h1>New England Ski Mountain Comparison Site</h1>
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>
      The website is a ski mountain review site, where users can compare
      mountains in the New England area side by side to decide which mountain to
      go up to for the weekend.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>
      The objective for this website is to make it easier for skiers to compare
      different ski mountains with different criteria. There are 76 mountains in
      New England and sometimes it is difficult to figure out what mountain is
      the best. This website will help users decide your mountain for the
      weekend depending on your needs such as bars, EV changing, and location.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>
      The target audience are people who are unfamiliar with the New Englandâ€™s
      76 ski mountains but want to figure out what mountain to go up to.
